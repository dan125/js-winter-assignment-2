# Javascript Winter 2014: Assignment #2 (Wednesday)

##Git/ Github Instructions
1. Make sure you are in the directory where you want your homework project directory to be stored
2. `Git clone 'urlGoesHere'`
3. cd to the project directory
4. `git checkout -b branchWithYourNameOnIt`
5. `mkdir dirWithYourNameOnIt`
6. `touch assignment2.js` to create the file with your homework in it. 
7. Do the exercises below (don't forget to save)
8. `git add assignment2.js` to add changes
9. `git commit -m "commit message here`
10. `git push` (make sure you are still on the branch with your name on it before you push)
11. Submit a pull request on github
12. Look at feedback
13. Make changes
14. Git add, then commit, then push (There is no need to get rid of the previous pull request and make a new one. Just push your new changes. The pull request will automatically update)

## Assignment 2
### Part 1
1. Write an `if` statement that prints the message "Javascript is awesome" to the console. 

### Part 2 
1. Write a `while` loop that prints out 1 through 10, one number at a time.

### Part 3
1. Write a `for` loop that does the exact same thing as the previous while loop

### Part 4
1. Create a `var` called cheese and set it equal to any name of cheese that you like. If you need help, go to [cheese.com](http://www.cheese.com/alphabetical/)

2. Create an `if else` statement that tests for whether or not the name of cheese is longer than 8 characters. If the cheese is longer than eight characters, print "that must be some stinky cheese!" to the console. Otherwise, print "That cheese might taste nice on some pizza!" to the console. 

### Part 5
1. Declare a `var` called `pizzaSize` and set it equal to the diameter that you think a good pizza should be (in inches).
2. Write a combination of loops and conditions that prints out the size (diameter) of the pizza from which you just ate a slice. 
    - For a pizza that is 9 inches to 18 inches, you should only print out the message 5 times. 
    - For a pizza larger than 18 inches, the message should print out 3 times. 
3. If the pizza is 8 inches or smaller, print out the message "That pizza was just too small". 

### Part 6 
1. Declare an arbitrary string of arbitrary length. 
2. Use a loop and a condition (of some sort). 
3. Print out the string, reversed and with its vowels deleted.

### Part 7 
1. Using one console.log statement, print out all of the numbers from 1 and 20. 
    - If the number is divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number 
    - If it's not divisible by 3, just print the number.
2. Add an else if statement to check if the number is divisible by 5, and if it is, print out "Buzz" instead of the number.
3. Add another if statement somewhere in your code that checks for numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5. For these special cases, print "FizzBuzz".
